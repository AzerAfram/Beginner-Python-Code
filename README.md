# Beginner-Python-Code
This is about a month's worth of practice in Python. Many useful little functions that help with important concepts, algorithms, and python functionality such as:
  Strings, integers and variables
  Functions
  Error handling
  Conditional statements
  For, while, and nested loops
  Classes, inheritance and Object Oriented programming (OOP)
  Lambda functions
  Python built-in functions
  Logging
  Object to Json and vice versa
  Implementation of Function decorators, class decorators, and wrappers with or without arguments
  Fundamental functions and concepts such as fibonacci, FizzBuzz, and hexadecimals
  Foundational algorithms such as selection, bubble, and merge sorts and binary search
  A handful of codewars kata's/questions on concepts such as digital root and cumulative sum

These are all well implemented and as simple as I could find. 
Everything is well labeled with eithier variables and/or comments of explanations or clarifications.
Quite a few of the code is originaly from sources such as:
